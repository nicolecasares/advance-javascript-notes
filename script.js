//Advance Javascript and Functions 

	//ALMOST EVERYTHING IS A OBJECT

	//to types of vales PRIMATIVES and OBJECTS

	//primatives are
		//numbers, strings,booleans, undifined, null

	//Objects are
		//arrays, functions, objects, dates,
		//wrappers for numbers, strings, booleans

	//Object-Oriented Programming
		//Objects interacting with one another throgh methods and properties
		//Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping clean.
	
	//Constructor/Prototype
		//aka class in other lang
		//using this we can creat as many instances as we want
		//acts like a blueprint 

	//Inheritance 
		//when one object is based on another object
		//the object gets acces to another objects peroperties and methods

	//Javascript is a prototype-based language 
		//which means inheritance works by using prototypes
		//every object has a prototype property. 

	//SUMMARY from Instructor

		//Every Javascript objects has a PROTOTYPE PROPERTY, which makes inheritace possible in JavaScript
		// The prototype of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want OTHER OJECTS TO INHERIT
		//The Constructorr's prototype is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it;
		//When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object's prototype.This continues until the method is found: prototype chain.
